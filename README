DESCRIPTION
This plugin lets you quickly recall previous insertions and insert them again
at the cursor position. Essentially, it's the built-in i_CTRL-A command
souped up with history and selection.

In insert mode, you can narrow down the candidates by typing a keyword first;
then, only insertions with a match will be offered as completion candidates.
In normal mode, you can directly recall the [count]'th previous insertion, or
have it list the last 9 insertions and let you choose.
To avoid that the many minor tactical edits clobber up the history, only
significant (longer) edits are recalled.

- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

USAGE
CTRL-X CTRL-A           Find previous insertions (i_CTRL-A, quote.) whose
                        contents match the keyword before the cursor. First, a
                        match at the beginning is tried; if that returns no
                        results, it may match anywhere.
                        Further use of CTRL-X CTRL-A will append insertions done
                        after the previous recall.

[count]q<CTRL-@>        Recall and append previous [count]'th insertion.

[count]q<CTRL-A>        Lists the last 9 insertions, then prompts for a number.
                        The chosen insertion is appended [count] times.
